	<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Josh Paul, I'm 21 years old and grew up in a town called Chatham, Ontario. Growing up, sports were a big part of my life. I grew up playing hockey and lacrosse until I was about 16 years old, then started just playing for leisure.

		I enjoy hanging out with my friends anbd family, swimming in my parents pool during the summer.

		I'm very interested in media design, since I have had a passion for tech pretty much my entire life, I feel that this program is very right for me and I am excited to further my knowledge as this course progresses.
